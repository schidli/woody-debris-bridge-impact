## Highlights

> - **Woody Debris Amplifies Impact**: The presence of woody debris significantly boosts both horizontal and vertical forces on bridge superstructures during debris flows, highlighting the need for debris-aware bridge designs .
> - **Profile Shape Matters**: While bridge profile shapes don't affect horizontal and positive vertical forces much, they do influence negative vertical forces, with full slab profiles facing higher impacts .
> - **Log Length Influence**: Medium-length logs (15 cm) cause the highest force impacts on full slab bridge profiles, underscoring the importance of considering log size in structural planning .
> - **Critical Design Insights**: The study's findings stress the importance of incorporating woody debris considerations into bridge designs to enhance resilience and stability in debris flow-prone areas .
> - **Call for More Research**: To better understand woody debris dynamics and improve mitigation strategies, further experimental studies are essential .
